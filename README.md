# Hacking Toolbox
---

A CLI hacking/cybersecurity swiss-army-knife. 

Based on the RVC Hacking Toolbox made by Josh Glovinsky as a helper in CTF competitions, this version parses arguments from the command line to execute common scripts and perform tasks in a (hopefully) easy and effective way. I thought it would be more convenient to use this toolbox like I use all other programs when in the command line.

**#TODO:** Structure the main code and possibly find a way to automate adding new scripts and arguments to parse in the future.
